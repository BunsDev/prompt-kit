prompt-kit is a set of customizable, high-quality components built for LLM applications, making it easy to design chat experiences quickly and beautifully.

prompt-kit is built on top of shadcn/ui with the same design principles. It's not a components library. It's a set of components designed for building AI interfaces.

This project is a work in progress, and we’re continuously improving and expanding the collection. We’d love to hear your feedback or see your contributions as it evolves!

prompt-kit is open source. Check out the code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/ibelick/prompt-kit).
